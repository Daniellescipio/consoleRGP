I think we should work on the fight sequence next.
this will involve...
creating choose a weapon function
battle :
choose weapon. 
battle diaglogue :player hits or misses, monster hit or misses
damage dialogue:damage for both moster and player will be some calculation factoring in monster and weapon level. 
player will be shown stamina and life level and given a choice to keep fighting or run...

After this we still need to program 
figthing the dragon, 
taking medicine, 
the weapons shop

food function needs to be debugged...
